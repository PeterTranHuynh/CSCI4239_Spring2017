Homework 4 - OpenGL 3 and 4

---ESTIMATED-TIME-SPENT--- 
6 hours and 00 minutes 

---Description---
Create a program that uses shaders in the OpenGL 3 or 4 style, that is using the
in and out qualifiers to pass variables into or between shaders and pass variables 
such as the transformation matrices and light properties into the shader as uniforms.

The program must implement lighting and textures, and define the scene using
vertex buffer objects.

I recommend you start with Example 6 and add lighting and textures to my shaders.

According to Apple, OpenGL 4.1 is supported on Macs built from 2011 onwards.  Older Macs only supports OpenGL 3.3

---Results---
Using example 6 as the initial template, and HW 2 and 3 FRAG and VERT shaders, I implemented lighting
in the vertex shader similar to previous HWs, then ported it as an input for the fragement shader
This was then set as uniforms within the OpenGL widget.
