Homework 9 - Particle Systems and Advanced Shaders

---ESTIMATED-TIME-SPENT--- 
4 hours and 30 minutes 

---Description---
For this assignment you can implement a particle engine or an advanced shader such
as a geometry, tesselation or compute shader.

If you choose to implement a particle engine, you can do small or large
particles, but it must be shader based, not CPU based.  For large particles
point sprites may be desirable.

Alternatively, you can create a program that uses one of the newer shader types
such as a geometry, tesselation or compute shader.

What to draw is up to you.  Choose something that illustrates the techniques you
are implementing.

---Results---
Using example 19 as the initial template, I used both a small and large particle creations to make a 
simple raining particle animation (small particles) and a moving comet (large particle).
This is done via the shader files that take in the openGL widget particle field instance.
