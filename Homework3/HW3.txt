
Homework 3: Performance
Investigate the performance of different elements of GLSL.  Examples of things
you may investigate is float vs. int, performance of constructs like if,
select, builtin functions vs. explicit calculaton, the cost of transcendental
functions, inline code vs. function calls, performance differences between
different video cards or operating systems, etc.

What the program should do is left to your imagination.  The scene could
involve lighting, textures, and similar features, but the assignment is to
investigate performance of different ways of doing things.

Make sure you disable VSYNC so that this measures to true frame rate.

What to submit:

1) README with discussion of results and brief instructions on how to use the
program;

2) One ZIP or TAR archive containing all files you are submitting;

3) Source code (shader and program), .pro and any data files I need;

4) Time it took you to complete the assignment.

The discussion of the results is the main deliverable for this homework.
